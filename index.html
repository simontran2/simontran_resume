        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi welcome to my website created by GitHub<br><br>

        	The properties of the site of TRPV1 Are outside of the phospholipid bilayer, occurring in the cell cycle checkpoints of G1, S, and G2. The heads are hydrophilic which allows them to flow through the cytoplasm at ease. The tails are hydrophobic, it avoids contact with anything related to water since it is a polar molecule. The TRPV1 allows H+ ions as it moves on to cell signaling, With the cyclic adenosine monophosphate, water eventually transfers to the protein kinase, moving on to the activations tie, which is given in the checkpoints of the cell cycle. The cell has to make sure that it takes action. The competitive inhibitor allows the blockage of the activation site, which makes it so that only one substrate is allowed to connect and link with the accusations tie given. With the blockage of the G1 to S transition in the cell cycle, it causes those cells to transfer to another place known as G0, in which the cell is considered to be ‚Äúuseless,‚Äù this prevents mitosis form happening in the cell since the cell can no longer continue throughout the cell cycle, as it has no completely finished its job of growing or DNA synthesis. <br><br>

        Calcineurin would enter the cell, as its main purpose is to remove the phosphate groups from the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor, this would cause exposure to see if the calcineurin is able to go through the steps of NFAT2, ATF#, and pGoG which eventually leads to the blockage of cell division. This effect would lead to a better understanding about how scientists can eliminate in order to easily go through the pGoG, which would help provide the possible answers of curing cancers or diseases, since calcineurin may have a chance to helps scientists solve any diseases that are possible, changing the amount of intensity of the Calcium. This is mainly shown in the figure of 2 since it demonstrates that if the calcineurin were to enter in and successfully able to get through the steps of the nucleus, it would eventually reach to the inducing apoptosis and the blockage of cell division, which could help solve many cases that scientists are wishing to solve. Starting with calcineurin before capsaicin, it can eliminate the possible choices and elements/compounds that scientists will need to find to create a medication for cancer or disease. Many researchers claim that many cancers have a mutated gene of pGoG since these properties block other genes and cells from entering the active site. With this blockage, it allows barely any substrates or cells to enter the active site, since it is known as the competitive inhibitor. This means that is quite competitive and hard to enter in the active cell, which would prevent the continuation of the cell cycle, which would make most cells useless. In support of his claim, most cancers are hard to treat normally, therefore it is proven that these genes are mutated, thus making it harder for scientists to encode and figure out how to correctly find the exact substrate or geen that fits perfectly with the activation site.
